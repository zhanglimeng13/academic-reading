### 1. What's the definition of plagiarism and multiple submissions? (2pt)

Academic plagiarism is the act of citing other people’s ideas, insights, results, and language expressions without affirming their source, whether intentional or unconscious.
Multiple submissions per manuscript mean that the same author or different authors of the same research group try or have published papers with the same or similar content in two or more journals at the same time or successively without the knowledge of the journal editor and reviewers. International, this phenomenon is also called repetitive publication, redundant publication, or self-plagiarism.
